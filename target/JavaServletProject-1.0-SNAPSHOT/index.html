        <h2>What is Post Map?</h2>
        <p>The Post Map allows you to search by username or hashtag and displays a list of Tweets or Youtube videos as
            well
            as a map of where each post was made in the world. You can click on each pin on the map to see details on
            the
            post. You can also create a bounding box on the map and it will display a list of Youtube videos and
            Facebook posts in that area. It will also put pins on a map of where these posts were made.</p>
